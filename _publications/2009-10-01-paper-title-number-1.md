excerpt: 'Memory access prediction is a crucial problem in data prefetchers, as it helps us improve memory performance and
reduce latency in computing systems. Existing works model the problem as a sequence prediction problem. This can
be limited in its ability to capture complex patterns and dependencies in memory access behavior. In recent years,
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising technique for modeling and predicting complex
relationships in graph-structured data. In this paper, we introduce G-MAP, a novel Graph Neural Network-based
framework for Memory Access Prediction. First, we propose Mem2Graph, a novel approach mapping a memory
access sequence to a graph representation, capturing both the spatial and temporal locality in the sequence. Second,
we implement various GNNs for G-MAP, including Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), Gated Graph Sequence
Neural Network (GG-NN), and Graph Attention Network (GAT). Those models take the graph generated from
Mem2Graph as input and predict future memory address jumps (deltas). We evaluate the effectiveness of G-MAP
using the SPEC 2006 benchmark. G-MAP using GG-NN shows the highest among all models, achieving averagely
0.7526 F1-Score, which is 10.77% higher than the Multi-Layer Perceptron baseline.'
