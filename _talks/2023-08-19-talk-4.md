Thank you for attending the session and for your overwhelming response! Here is the [link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12IKnA-F35J4fslBHyeeXeZashdbBZMr8_aRN3kQsfGA/edit#slide=id.p) to the presentation/slides used in the session.

On further demand, I've linked another repository with an exhaustive list of research internships that UGs can possibly apply for: [Research Internship Database](https://github.com/himahuja/Research-Internships-for-Undergraduates). Hope you do check it out.

Special thanks to Srikar, Ayush for helping me organize this smooothly and to all the speakers for sharing their valuable insights on these programs.
