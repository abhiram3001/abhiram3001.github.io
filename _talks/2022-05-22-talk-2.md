My talk on Bell Labs as a part of the final presentation for EE5004: Seminar on History of Electrical Engineering course. Bell Labs has been shaping the future with innovations over the past 90 years. Be it the first ever transistor, the first silicon solar cell, the first ever laser or the first communication satellite, involved in nearly every technological milestone in the last nine decades.
A total of 9 Nobel Prizes and 5 Turing Prizes awarded to the work here. So how exactly did Bell Labs create the future that we live in today?
