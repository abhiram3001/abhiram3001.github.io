This project was the culmination of all my learnings about Information Theory (EE5143) under the guidance of Prof. Andrew Thangaraj. EE5143 was easily one of the best courses I have done in the seven semesters of my UG so far. The project topic is a really beautiful one, with an opportunity to delve very deep into the intricacies of Information Theory. 

I also got a chance to present my work to a class of ~30 students along with Prof. Andrew, and while my presentation went on for almost thrice as long as the prescribed time limit, I am extremely glad that the feedback I got from my peers and Prof. Andrew was really encouraging.
