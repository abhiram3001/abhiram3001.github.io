This tutorial on Machine Learning starts off with the very basics of gradient descent, and progresses steadily into more advanced topics like SVMs. Also, my first-time ever conducting a session for over 200 students from various disciplines.

Special thanks to Ishan Pendse and Kshitij Shah for their guidance throughout.
