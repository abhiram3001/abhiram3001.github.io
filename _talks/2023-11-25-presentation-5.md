[Ruban](https://github.com/Ruban-VP) and I got a chance to present a poster titled: 'Signal Decomposition via Quadratic-Separable Optimization'. 

Here, we consider the classic problem decomposing a signal with missing entries into a sum of components and present an optimization-based signal decomposition framework:
Quadratic-Separable Solver (QSS) for this problem. We also test this approach out on various real-life applications ranging from $CO_2$ calibration to soiling losses in solar cells. 

You can find our poster [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NqfXpyX_p350oUgFzXYFdyLnUd2P2jMs/view).

Along with the poster, here's a linktree with a brief presentation, all our codes and some mathematical precursors behind this problem explained:
