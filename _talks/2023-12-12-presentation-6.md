As a part of the end-semester (finals) for EE4140: Digital Communication Systems, I did an extensive review of existing 
blind algorithms (Godard, Sato, CMA, APA-CM, RCA, MMA, Stop-and-Go) and simulated them for a variety of channel models and samples generated from a QPSK/16-QAM constellation. 
As intuitively expected for the given setting, Stop-and-Go is the best blind equalizer. The simulation results and the experimental settings are as specified in the presentation. (Code can be made available upon request)
