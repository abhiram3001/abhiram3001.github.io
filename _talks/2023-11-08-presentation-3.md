Kalman Filtered Compressed Sensing (KF-CS): My work was on solving the classic problem of reconstructing time sequences of sparse signals with minimal
measurements using KF-CS. I was able to demonstrate its performance gain in scenarios with slowly evolving sparsity (such as MRI/CT scan), showing
that KF-CS achieves a performance rate comparable to that of genie-aided KF when the initial support of the signal is known.
