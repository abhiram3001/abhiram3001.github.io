Have you ever wondered how big businesses forecast their sales? Or maybe try to predict times when they need to stock up on their inventory? In order to help you build this reference code for most data science pipelines and develop your thought process we bring to you a session where we walk you through building this reference code for the Predict Future Sales contest on Kaggle. Here is an opportunity for you to explore the problem, learn the different ways to approach it and to get yourself your base reference code for building complete pipelines.

Problem Statement: This challenge serves as final project for the "How to win a data science competition" Coursera course. In this competition you will work with a challenging time-series dataset consisting of daily sales data, kindly provided by one of the largest Russian software firms - 1C Company. We are asking you to predict total sales for every product and store in the next month. By solving this competition you will be able to apply and enhance your data science skills. The evaluation metric for the contest is the RMSE score.

Session Date: 6th November, 2021
