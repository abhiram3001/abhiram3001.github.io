I am G Abhiram, a fourth-year undergraduate student at the Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Madras. My primary research interests are in Signal Processing, Information Theory and Machine Learning. 

I am currently working on my Bachelor's thesis in post-OCT Signal Processing. I previously had the golden opportunity to work on new-age modulation techniques like OTFS, ODSS, and mitigating fractional doppler interference in OTFS under the guidance of Prof. [David Koilpillai](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~koilpillai/). I spent the summer of 2023 at USC working with Prof. [Viktor Prasanna](http://ceng.usc.edu/~prasanna) and [Pengmiao Zhang](https://sites.google.com/usc.edu/pengmiao/home) on building a GNN-based data prefetcher for memory access prediction.  

Research Interests 
-----
My general research interests are centered around Signal Processing and Communications, Machine Learning. Most of my undergraduate coursework/research has also been focused on these domains. 

While I have spent a significant amount of my UG trying to specialize in these fields, I am always on the lookout for other exciting fields of research. Some other (recent) topics of interest that I have enjoyed exploring include:

- ML-based Memory Access Prediction (Check out [Data Science Lab, USC](https://sites.usc.edu/dslab/) for more)
- Wireless Sensing (a hot research topic)
- Graph Neural Networks (and their vast applications)
- Non-linear Control Theory (more specifically, Kuramoto Oscillators)
- Differential Pursuit-Evasion Games
- Reinforcement Learning (most of my initial project work centered around this)


Talks, Seminars, & Outreach
-----
I am involved in various workshop, lecturing, tutoring, and seminar activities; check out the Talks and Teaching sections for more. I am constantly on the look out for newer, challenging projects/other ventures. If you are interested in collaborating/working with me on something interesting, feel free to reach out to me at **gabhiram** *[at]* **smail** *[dot]* **iitm** *[dot]* **ac** *[dot]* **in**.

My journey at IIT Madras
-----
After an intense but fruitful period of JEE preparation, I joined IIT Madras in Nov. 2020 to pursue my B.Tech in Electrical Engineering.

Misc
----
When I am not working, I try to follow my passion in food, music (rock), and travel. I am also a movie buff, and here is my own must-watch [list](https://youthful-salmon-185.notion.site/Must-Watch-movies-2023-8867a7164aaa4d9f947d4209f57f453b?pvs=4). Favourite bands include: Pink Floyd, Nirvana, Tool, Metallica, AC/DC, GnR and Linkin Park, which is where my love for rock music started.  I am pursuing all of the above leisure activities on a very amateur level, but I try as hard as possible to take some time off and rejuvenate with these.

I used to love reading and I hope to get back at it someday. I also enjoy reflecting upon life given my extremely philophical outlook.
