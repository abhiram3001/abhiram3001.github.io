I am G Abhiram, a fourth-year undergraduate student at the Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Madras. My primary research interests are in Information Theory, Wireless Communications and Machine Learning. 

I am currently working on my Bachelor's thesis on developing error control coding-based approaches to generative AI under the co-guidance of [Prof. Nambi Seshadri](https://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/faculty/profile?id=437) and  [Prof. David Koilpillai](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~koilpillai/). I am also exploring some interesting information-theoretic results in Crowdsourcing in collaboration with [Prof. Andrew Thangaraj](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~andrew/). I spent the summer of 2023 at USC working with [Prof. Viktor Prasanna](http://ceng.usc.edu/~prasanna) and [Pengmiao Zhang](https://sites.google.com/usc.edu/pengmiao/home) on building a GNN-based data prefetcher for memory access prediction. Previously, I had the opportunity to work on two major aspects of new-age modulation techniques like OTFS, ODSS: a) low-complexity Channel Estimation and b) Inter-Doppler Interference (IDI) under the guidance of [Prof. David Koilpillai](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~koilpillai/).

Research Interests 
-----
My general research interests are centered around Communication Theory, Statistical Inference and Information Theory. Most of my undergraduate coursework/research has also been focused on these domains. 

While I have spent a significant amount of my UG trying to specialize in these fields, I am always on the lookout for other exciting fields of research. Some other topics of interest that I have briefly worked on include:

- ML-based Memory Access Prediction (Check out [Data Science Lab, USC](https://sites.usc.edu/dslab/) for more)
- Non-linear Control Theory (more specifically, Kuramoto Oscillators)
- Differential Pursuit-Evasion Games (technical lead for a related [Mathematics Club](https://cfi.iitm.ac.in/clubs/mathematics-club) project)
- Reinforcement Learning (most of my initial work in [AI Club](https://cfi.iitm.ac.in/clubs/ai-club) centered around this)


Talks, Seminars, & Outreach
-----
I am involved in various workshop, lecturing, tutoring, and seminar activities; check out the Talks and Teaching sections for more. I am constantly on the look out for newer, challenging projects/other ventures. If you are interested in collaborating/working with me on something interesting, feel free to reach out to me at **gabhiram** *[at]* **smail** *[dot]* **iitm** *[dot]* **ac** *[dot]* **in**.

My journey at IIT Madras
-----
After an intense but fruitful period of JEE preparation, I joined IIT Madras in Nov. 2020 to pursue my B.Tech in Electrical Engineering.

Contact
-----
- Email:  **gabhiram** *[at]* **smail** *[dot]* **iitm** *[dot]* **ac** *[dot]* **in** (school)
- You can very often find me hanging around at [ESB](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in), or [Sudha & Shankar Innovation Hub](https://www.t5eiitm.org/building-of-the-future/), so feel free to have a quick chat in case you drop by!

Misc
----
When I am not working, I try to follow my passion in food, music (rock), and travel. I am also a movie buff, and here is my own must-watch [list](https://youthful-salmon-185.notion.site/Must-Watch-movies-2023-8867a7164aaa4d9f947d4209f57f453b?pvs=4). Favourite bands include: Pink Floyd, Nirvana, Tool, Metallica, AC/DC, GnR and Linkin Park, which is where my love for rock music started.  I am pursuing all of the above leisure activities on a very amateur level, but I try as hard as possible to take some time off and rejuvenate with these.

I used to love reading and I hope to get back at it someday. I also enjoy reflecting upon life given my extremely philophical outlook.
