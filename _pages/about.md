I am Abhiram (Abhi) Gorle, an MS student in the Department of Electrical Engineering at Stanford University. I am quite fortunate to be advised by [Prof. John Cioffi](https://cioffi-group.stanford.edu) and [Prof. Tsachy Weissman](https://stanford.edu/~tsachy/). My research interests primarily include Information Theory, Wireless Communications, Statistics and Machine Learning. 

Prior to this, I completed my B.Tech. in Electrical Engineering from IIT Madras (India) in 2024, graduating second in a cohort of 155 students. My final-year research mainly focused on communication-theoretic approaches to image compression and generation, under the co-guidance of [Prof. Nambi Seshadri](https://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/faculty/profile?id=437) and [Prof. David Koilpillai](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~koilpillai/). During my time at IIT Madras, I was also fortunate to have been guided by [Prof. Aravind R](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/faculty/profile/aravind) and [Prof. Andrew Thangaraj](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/andrew/) through various courses, teaching endeavours and occasional research discussions. 

Teaching, Service & Outreach
-----
I am involved in various teaching and seminar activities; check out the Talks and Teaching sections for a detailed list. At Stanford, I have served as a teaching assistant (TA) for over 300 students in [ENGR76](https://web.stanford.edu/class/engr76/) (Information Science and Engineering) in Spring 2025, and [EE178](https://ee178.stanford.edu) (Probabilistic Systems Analysis) in Winter 2025. I was also a course supporter for [EE276](https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee276/) (Information Theory) and a TA for CS349F seminar in Winter 2025. I have served as a reviewer for: the ML for Communications track at [ICC '25](https://icc2025.ieee-icc.org) and the 2nd [AI4Math workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/ai4mathworkshopicml2025) at ICML '25. More recently, I have also been excited about building frameworks for mathematical and scientific reasoning using foundational AI models.

I am constantly on the lookout for newer, challenging projects/ventures. If you are interested in discussing more about my current research interests or collaborating, feel free to reach out to me at **abhiramg** *[at]* **stanford** *[dot]* **edu**.

Misc
----
When I am not working, I try to follow my passion for [food](https://app.beliapp.com/lists/abhig3001), music, and travel/hiking (especially around the Bay Area). Some of my favourite bands include: Pink Floyd, Nirvana, Tool, Metallica, AC/DC, GnR, RHCP and Linkin Park, which is where my love for rock music started. I pursue all of these leisure activities at a very amateur level but try to regularly take time off to recharge with them. I am also a movie buff (thrillers, crime, etc.), and here is my own must-watch [list](https://youthful-salmon-185.notion.site/Must-Watch-movies-2023-8867a7164aaa4d9f947d4209f57f453b?pvs=4) (to update).

I used to love reading, and I hope to get back at it someday. I also enjoy reflecting upon life given my extremely philophical outlook.
