My journey at IIT Madras
-----
After an intense but ultimately rewarding period of JEE preparation, I joined IIT Madras in Nov. 2020 to pursue my B.Tech in Electrical Engineering.

In my junior year, I had the opportunity to work on two major aspects of new-age modulation techniques like OTFS, ODSS: a) low-complexity Channel Estimation and b) Inter-Doppler Interference (IDI) under the guidance of [Prof. David Koilpillai](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~koilpillai/). I spent the summer of 2023 at USC working on building a GNN-based data prefetcher for memory access prediction. In Fall 2023, I was fortunate to collaborate with the [Applied Optics group](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/AppliedOptics/) on post-optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) signal processing, enhancing spatial resolution using synchrosqueezing to surpass traditional fourier-based methods. 

I have also been a teaching assistant for the following courses: 
- 2024: EE1101 (Signals & Systems) with [Prof. LN Theagarajan](https://sites.google.com/view/lakshminarasimhan/bio), EE5143 (Information Theory)
- 2023: EE2016 (Microprocessors), [EE2025](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~uday/2024b-EE2025/index.html) (Engineering Electromagnetics), EE6133 (Multirate Signal Processing)

While a significant part of my undergrad coursework involved delving deeper into communication theory, I was always on the lookout for other exciting fields of research. Some other topics of interest that I briefly explored include:
- ML-based Memory Access Prediction (Check out [Data Science Lab, USC](https://sites.usc.edu/dslab/) for more)
- Non-linear Control Theory (more specifically, Kuramoto Oscillators)
- Differential Pursuit-Evasion Games (technical lead for a related [Mathematics Club](https://cfi.iitm.ac.in/clubs/mathematics-club) project)
- Reinforcement Learning (most of my initial work in [AI Club](https://cfi.iitm.ac.in/clubs/ai-club) centered around this)

Outside academics, I was a part of the following teams/initiatives (in alphabetical order): AI Club, Avanti Fellows, Chennai 36, Culinary Arts Club, [EE Research Club](https://sites.google.com/smail.iitm.ac.in/eerc?authuser=0), IITM TV, Inter IIT Tech Meet 12.0 Organizing Committee, Mathematics Club, EE Placement Team, Shaastra Events, Writing Club. 

I also helped organize the following seminal events: IITM's 1st Integration Bee in 2023, etc.
