I will be a TA for second half of the course, which will be instructed by Prof. Manivasakan. This will build upon ARM processor from the first half, and focus on AVR Microcontroller, various funtionalities of the same such as Assembly, Hardware, Interrupt and C-interfacing will be demonstrated in the lab sessions.

Course Outline
======
Instructor: Prof. R Manivasakan

The lesson plan has been uploaded on moodle. (Access restricted to IITM students)

There are two batches - A & B. A comes on Mon & Wed, B comes on Tues & Fri, respective Labs on Tues & Wed.

Evaluation & Books
======
- Assessment pattern: I have linked the same [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vSgrv0AioVbJ-N96E9y8xmd6UEyjadMb/view?usp=sharing).
- Use the course moodle to access all the lecture slides by Prof. Manivasakan, this is a must-refer resource. A lot of the moodle quizzes and endsem will be heavily centered around these slides. 
- References: Book on AVR by Mazidi, linked [here](https://electrovolt.ir/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/AVR_Microcontroller_and_Embedded_Electrovolt.ir_.pdf)
  
Labs
=====
Current plan is to have 5 Lab Sessions - 1 on ARM, 4 on AVR. Among the 50% from second half of the course, lab has 25% weightage. The theory endsem takes up the other 25%.
 
**Breakdown of the lab part is as follows:**
- Lab Endsem (12.5%)
- Pre-lab: Writeups will be uploaded, you are expected to go through the same before each lab session.
- Based on your understanding of the same and other topics taught during theory sessions, you will have Moodle quizzes. (5%)
- During the lab: A demonstration will also be done during lab hours, after which students are expected to replicate or improve upon the same in the lab session. Respective TAs will evaluate you on the same. (5%)
- Post-lab tasks include submitting a detailed report of the experiment along with results obtained during the lab hours. (2.5%)
